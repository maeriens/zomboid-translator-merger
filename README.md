# Zomboid Translation Merger

This is a small project to help translating what is missing from other languages compared to the EN transalations.

What it does is to compare an uploaded file to it's English counterpart, and produce a merged version of both of them,
keeping the translated lines but also adding the (unmodified) missing English ones.

This is for files that have 1 to 1 translations - so the files inside folders like `Muldraugh`, `Riverside`, etc, `SurvivalGuide` and the spec `language.txt` are not supported and the page alerts and ignores them when referenced.
